# edovshitler
edovshitler is a simple game for computers that I enjoyed making it. It's maked using Python, especially with pygame library and SQLite3.
--------------------------
It was develop with pygame 1.9.5 library that helps game creating. It stores the record (maximum bombs avoided, maximum missiles shooted and maximum enemies killed) in the result.db database (SQLite3). It's built with pyinstaller --onefile command.
It can run on Windows 10 | 8.1 | 8 | 7 | Vista
--------------------------

1) Download all the repo
2) Execute the /dist/initdb.py file for initialize the database (or follow the step 4)
3) How to play: 
      3a) run the edovshitler.bat file by clicking two times on it
      3b) with a command prompt in edovshitler folder type edovshitler and ENTER
      3c) double click on /dist/game.exe file
4) If you want to reset the database:
      4a) run the reset.bat file by clicking two times on it
      4b) with a command prompt in edovshitler folder type reset and ENTER
      4c) double click on /dist/initdb.py file
5) Have fun playing it!
