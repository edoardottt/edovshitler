It works nicely on Windows, maybe Linux testing...  
edovshitler is a simple game I enjoyed making it. It's made using Python with pygame library and SQLite3.

Get Started :mega:
---------

 **Build it with pyinstaller**

To create your own executable file with your changes:

- Download pyinstaller: `pip install pyinstaller`

- then execute(inside the edovshitler folder): `pyinstaller --onefile game.py`

(The .exe is inside /dist folder)

All the files you see in dist folder except the executable file are mandatory (images and script used by .exe file)

It can run on Windows 10 | 8.1 | 8 | 7 | Vista


Description :mega:
---------

It's developed with pygame 1.9.5 library that helps game creating. It's a 2D game, based on Alien (a similar pc game). The game controls are:

- Left arrow key = move to left
      
- Right arrow key = move to right
      
- Space key = shoot the enemies
      
- P key = Pause and resume the game
      
It stores the record (maximum bombs avoided, maximum missiles shooted and maximum enemies killed) in the result.db database (SQLite3).
