# edovshitler ðŸ‘¾ ðŸŽ®
---------------------

edovshitler is a simple game for computers that I enjoyed making it. It's maked using Python, especially with pygame library and SQLite3.

--------------------------
DESCRIPTION :mega:
--------------------------

It was develop with pygame 1.9.5 library that helps game creating. It's a 2d game, based on alien (a similar pc game). The commands are:

      - Left arrow button - move to left
      
      - Right arrow button - move to right
      
      - Space button - shoot to enemies
      
      - P button - Pause and resume the game
      
It stores the record (maximum bombs avoided, maximum missiles shooted and maximum enemies killed) in the result.db database (SQLite3). It's built with pyinstaller --onefile command.

**So, you can create your own exe file with pyinstaller.**
For download it, execute:

      pip install pyinstaller

And then (inside the edovshitler folder) :

      pyinstaller --onefile game.py

(The .exe is into /dist)
It can run on Windows 10 | 8.1 | 8 | 7 | Vista
