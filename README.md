# edovshitler ðŸ‘¾ ðŸŽ®

edovshitler is a simple game for computers that I enjoyed making it. It's made using Python, especially with pygame library and SQLite3.

DESCRIPTION :mega:
--------------------------

**The files in the first level are used to develop the game. In dist,build and pycache folders, there are files built with pyinstaller **

It's important that all the files that are in dist folder stay in dist folder.

It's developed with pygame 1.9.5 library that helps game creating. It's a 2D game, based on Alien (a similar pc game). The game controls are:

- Left arrow key = move to left
      
- Right arrow key = move to right
      
- Space key = shoot the enemies
      
- P key = Pause and resume the game
      
It stores the record (maximum bombs avoided, maximum missiles shooted and maximum enemies killed) in the result.db database (SQLite3). 

It's built with 'pyinstaller --onefile file.py' command.
To create your own executable file with your changes:

For download pyinstaller, execute:

      pip install pyinstaller

And then (inside the edovshitler folder) :

      pyinstaller --onefile game.py

(The .exe is into /dist)

All the files you see in dist folder except the executable file are mandatory (images and script used by .exe file)

It can run on Windows 10 | 8.1 | 8 | 7 | Vista
